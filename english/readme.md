# üôåIntroduction
- If I were to summarize myself in one sentence, I am a `developer who doesn't give up easily, even when my task seems daunting` I hardly gave up when I encountered challenging situations during development.
- I believe having an `open attitude` to study what I don't know and try to fix what is lacking is important. I am a `fast learner`. I have searched for what to study on my own without relying on educational institutions, and recorded what I studied on my GitHub to remember what I learned.
- I believe that `team harmony` is important to create good software and we should think about how to foster it since we can solve problems that cannot be solved alone if we work together.

# üå†Tech skills
### Database
- have designed DB tables considering [Normalization](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Database/Normalization) and [Indexing](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Database/Indexing).
- have maintained data consistency using [Transactions](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Database/Transaction), and implemented [distributed transactions](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Server-side/Microservices%20architecture/Saga%20pattern) between microservices.
- have been utilizing [SQL](https://github.com/vacu9708/Algorithm/tree/main/Algorithm%20traning/SQL%20training)
- have considered and utilized the pros and cons of [UUID and auto-increment keys](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Database/UUID%20VS%20Sequential%20as%20a%20primary%20key).
### Server-side
- have studied the theory, pros and cons, and usage of [JWT and Session login](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Auth/JWT%2C%20session), and applied them to login implementation.
- read the official documents of [OAuth](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Auth/OAuth) API and implemented signin with Google(Also signin with naver).
- developed inter-process communication and [video conferences](https://github.com/vacu9708/video-conference) using [operating system sockets and websockets](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Socket%20(websocket)).
- developed features such as JWT revocation and rate limiting using [Redis](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Database/Redis).
- developed a microservice responsible for emails using [Kafka](https://github.com/vacu9708/Tools-etc/tree/main/Messaging%20system(Kafka)) to distribute server load through decoupled processing. I applied [load balancing](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Server-side/Service%20discovery%2C%20Load%20balancing) by setting up partitions and consumer groups.
- studied the theory, pros and cons of [microservices](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Server-side/Microservices%20architecture/Concepts), implemented them, and prevented server failure propagation using a circuit breaker.
- I understood the problems of http and set up an [https](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Security/Encryption) server.
### Development methodology and paradigm
- have studied the concepts and design principles of [Object Oriented Programming](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Development%20methodology%20and%20paradigm/Object%20Oriented%20Programming) and strive to make designs that are easy to understand and good.
- have studied and applied [Aspect Oriented Programming](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Development%20methodology%20and%20paradigm/Aspect%20Orient%20Programming) in necessary situations.
- have studied [concurrent programming](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Development%20methodology%20and%20paradigm/Concurrent%20programming) and [synchronization of shared memory](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Operating%20system/Process%20synchronization), and recognize their importance. I have done asynchronous programming using Spring Webflux and JavaScript async-await. I reduced thread overhead by using a thread pool for concurrent email sending.
- have studied [test codes](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Development%20methodology%20and%20paradigm/DevOps/Testing) and written test codes using junit.
### DevOps, etc
- have set up a linux server on AWS EC2 for [Cloud](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Web%20development/Server-side/Cloud) and implemented file upload and download using AWS S3.
- have utilized [Docker and docker-compose](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Development%20methodology%20and%20paradigm/DevOps/Containerization).
- have set up [CI/CD](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge/tree/main/Development%20methodology%20and%20paradigm/DevOps/CI%2CCD) using AWS EC2 + Jenkins + Docker.
- have used [Git](https://github.com/vacu9708/Tools-etc/tree/main/Git) with commands like clone, pull, push, reset, etc., and have done development by dividing branches and merging through pull requests.
- implemented [data structures](https://github.com/vacu9708/Data-structure) using C++ and Python.
- [Study records](https://github.com/vacu9708/Fundamental-knowledge)
