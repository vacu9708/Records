**Coasia Nexell**

- **Camera System Development & Debugging**
    
    - Developed and optimized camera device drivers for **Samsung ExynosAuto V920** on **Linux** and **Android** platforms.
    - Created a **shell script** to swap pre-built camera drivers without requiring system reboots, improving workflow efficiency.
    - Used **OpenCV** to align streaming windows when using **GStreamer** with **Wayland**.
- **Technical Support & Issue Resolution**
    
    - Assisted customers with **camera hardware and software** issues, including explaining RGB-to-RGBA format limitations from the hardware datasheet.
    - Provided guidance on **simultaneous camera execution** with **GStreamer** and implemented a patch to fix **VSync issues** by verifying signals with an oscilloscope.
- **BSP Validation & Debugging**
    
    - Automated **BSP validation** scripts using **Shell scripting** to test various camera models after BSP updates.
    - Debugged critical camera **I2C communication errors**, including missing **RX/TX rate settings** and JSON parsing issues in camera middleware.
    - Ensured compatibility of **RGGB20 color formats** in middleware.
- **Porting Raspberry Pi Camera to ExynosAuto**
    
    - Enabled **MIPI lanes** and verified signals via **oscilloscope**.
    - Adapted **I2C write functions** to transfer **camera settings** from Raspberry Pi to ExynosAuto.
    - Identified limitations in real-time **ISP tuning** compared to Raspberry Pi implementations.
- **ISP Tuning & Debugging for Naver Labs**
    
    - Diagnosed **CSI channel errors** using **multi-board testing** to isolate hardware failures.
    - Modified camera drivers to support **single-camera operation per CSI channel** for defect analysis.
    - Created a **Python script** for automated driver generation, streamlining the debugging process.
- **Android Camera Sample App Development**
    
    - Developed a **camera sample app** using **Android Studio**, featuring preview, capture, image thumbnail, and parameter settings.
    - Fixed an issue where **HAL resolution constraints** prevented the use of high-resolution cameras.
- **Code Analysis & Documentation**
    
    - Analyzed **Camera Middleware, Color Space Conversion, and Android External View System** codebases and presented findings.
    - Used **block diagrams, sequence diagrams, and call hierarchy tools** (VSCode, GDB) for effective debugging.
    - Investigated **image buffer formats (YUYV, RGBA)** to understand image data storage.
- **Unit Testing & Automation**
    
    - Developed **unit test code** for camera drivers using **KUnit** and **GCov**.
    - Automated **KUnit test template generation** with Python to improve development efficiency.
- **Miscellaneous Contributions**
    
    - Built a **Python script** to log **latest BSP commits** for easier debugging after updates.
    - Completed **Trace32 debugging training** for deeper embedded system analysis.
