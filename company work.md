**Embedded BSP Intern**  
_Dec 2023 – Mar 2024_

- Worked independently on assigned projects after receiving clear goals and directions.
- Studied embedded software fundamentals: data structures, computer architecture, operating systems, ARM architecture, Yocto, and Docker.
- Learned bootloader and U-Boot command development.
- Explored Linux kernel and device driver development.

**Embedded BSP Engineer (Focus: Camera)**  
_Mar 2024 – Present_

- Develop and support camera software on platforms based on the Samsung ExynosAuto V920 running Linux and Android.
- Work with C/C++, Python, and Kotlin using tools such as GDB, UML (drawio, PlantUML), Yocto, Docker, CMake, Shell scripting, and GStreamer.
- In an AI object detection project, wrote shell scripts to swap camera device drivers without rebuild/reboot and used OpenCV to adjust streaming window positions in Wayland.
- Assisted customers by verifying hardware capabilities via datasheet review, explaining multi-camera setups using GStreamer, and resolving vsync issues through patching and oscilloscope validation.
- Set up test environments and automated shell scripts for BSP validation and debugging, including:
    - Verifying Android External View System functionality.
    - Fixing I2C configuration issues between the camera device driver and hardware.
    - Addressing JSON parsing errors and adding missing color format support in middleware.
- Ported a Raspberry Pi camera to the ExynosAuto platform by enabling MIPI pins as specified in circuit schematics, verifying CSI register status, and adjusting device driver functions for camera settings.
- Supported ISP tuning for Naver Labs by debugging I2C errors in CSI channels, automating camera device driver generation with Python, and adding I2C communication logging to assist in diagnosing issues.
- Developed an Android camera sample app in Android Studio that features preview, capture, image thumbnail, and parameter settings, and resolved resolution limitations in the camera HAL.
- Analyzed and presented code from camera middleware, color space conversion middleware, and Android External View System using diagrams and debugging tools.
- Wrote unit tests for the camera device driver using KUnit and GCOV, and automated KUnit template generation with Python.
- Created a Python script to log the latest commits from all BSP repositories, streamlining post-update debugging processes.
- Completed Trace32 training.
