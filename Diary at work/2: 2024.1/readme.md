## Summary of this month
- **Visualization** is everything to understand and explain something.
- **Software engineering** like test code, Software Requirements Specifications is important when dealing with real work.
- **Data** is compelling evidence when convincing someone.
- Studied some new **data structures and algorithms** and reviewed those I studied.
- Studied some low-level knowledge like [**buses(API, AXI)**](https://github.com/vacu9708/Study-records/tree/main/Embedded_system/Bus), [**ARM architecture**](https://github.com/vacu9708/Study-records/tree/main/Embedded_system/ARM%20architecture)
- Studied how to build custom linux systems using [**Yocto**](https://github.com/vacu9708/Study-records/tree/main/Embedded_system/Yocto)
- Studied **Docker** and **Source Code Management**
- Studied [**U-boot**](https://github.com/vacu9708/Study-records/tree/main/Embedded_system/u-boot)
